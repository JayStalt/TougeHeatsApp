# Touge Heats - Documentation Report

## 1. Project Overview
### Application Name: **Touge Heats**
**Developer:** Jamison  
**Platform:** Android  
**Development Environment:** Android Studio  

**Touge Heats** is a mobile application designed to track and log driving sessions on touge (mountain pass) roads. It provides users with features to monitor lap times, save session data, and analyze performance trends over time. The app is inspired by fitness tracking applications like *MapMyRun* but tailored for motorsports and driving enthusiasts.

## 3. Technical Specifications
### **Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Java/Kotlin (Android SDK)
- **Backend:** Firebase / SQLite
- **Database:** Firestore / Room Database
- **APIs Used:** Google Maps API, Firebase Authentication

### **System Architecture:**
1. **User opens the app** → Loads login screen (if required)
2. **Session starts** → GPS tracking begins, recording lap times
3. **Session ends** → Data is saved locally and synced to the cloud
4. **User views past sessions** → Retrieves session data from the database for review

## 4. User Guide
### **Installation & Setup:**
1. Download *Touge Heats* from the Play Store (if available) or install via APK.
2. Create an account using email/password authentication.
3. Grant location permissions for GPS tracking.
4. Start a new session and drive!

### **Using the App:**
- Tap **"Start Session"** to begin tracking.
- View real-time speed, distance, and estimated lap time.
- Stop the session to save results.
- Browse saved sessions in the history tab.

## 5. Testing & Debugging
### **Debugging Process:**
- Used Android Studio's Logcat for real-time debugging.
- Simulated GPS data to test location tracking.
- Debugged database sync issues in Firebase.
- Tested UI responsiveness across multiple Android devices.

### **Known Issues:**
- **GPS Drift:** Some inaccuracies in location tracking in low-signal areas.
- **Battery Drain:** High GPS usage can impact battery life.
